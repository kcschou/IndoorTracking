# IndoorTracking
This repository contains the source code for two work in progress indoor localization systems. The systems are made for two different technologies; Qualisys (a motion capture system), and RPLIDAR.

The system based on Qualisys is in the Motion Capture folder, which contains a Python script used to extract and translate the data from the QTM. The system using an RPLIDAR is in the LiDAR folder. The LiDAR folder contains a Python script for extracting the readings from the unit (available in the Python folder) and our filtering algorithms and visualization (available in the Processing folder) in the form of a Processing solution.

This repository is made public to serve as inspiration for others and is not in active development.
